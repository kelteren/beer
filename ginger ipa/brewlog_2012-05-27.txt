== Brew day (2012-05-27) ==

PÃ¤r came over and helped out. Started around 13:00, done at
17:30.

This was my first time doing a yeast starter. About 1.5l water with
150g DME + Safale US-05 and some yeast nutrient. Fermented in room
temperature for 36 hours, then 5 hours in the fridge before
pitching.

=== Recipe mods ===

Recipe calls for 2.4 kg DME (0.8*LME), but I did 2.8 kg instead to
bump up the SG a bit. I'm using the prescribed amount of honey this
time though, so I'm hoping to get roughly the same SG as before but
perhaps with more maltiness in the final product.

The specialty malts were the same as in the 2012-02-25 brew.

Added 80g ginger instead of the recipe's 60g.

No big problems, but I forgot to add protafloc and yeast
nutrient. Stupid. I'll try to remedy this with gelatine later on.

I boiled and cooled 3 pots of water to make sure I had enough to top
off the fermentor, but I still ended up 2 litres
short. =). Fail. Topped with water from the tap instead.

OG: 1.060

This was my first time using a yeast starter. 1.5 l water with 150 g
DME. Fermentation in room temperature for 36 hours, then 5 hours in
the fridge prior to decanting and pitching.

Primary fermentation was active within 3 hours of pitching.

Main issue now is the weather. The wardrobe I ferment in is at 24 C,
while the previous batch fermented at 19 C. I suspect this will be a
very different beer. I could have set it to ferment in the basement
instead, which should be ~20 C, but it's such a pain in the ass to
carry it around. The 24 C will have to suffice.

Temperature control is tricky...
