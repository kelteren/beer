Trying out all grain with the BIAB method this time.

Scaling it all down linearly to half the batch size.

== Starter (2012-08-23) ==

Made a starter wort with 1.5l water and 150g light DME. Pitched 1 pack
of Nottingham ale yeast from Danstar. Let it ferment on the stir plate
for 36 hours. Crashed in fridge (5 C) over night. Big and healthy
looking yeast cake at the bottom of the flask now. FG 1.009.

Boiling directly in the erlenmeyer flask worked well, but I had to
pull it off the heat every now and then to keep it from foaming over.

== Brew day (2012-08-26) ==

=== Mash ===

Added the grains to 11 liters of water at 68 C. Temperature dropped to
67 C, which was less than I expected. Guessing I pulled the kettle
from the stove too late and thereby overshot the 68 C target.

1 hour mash. Temperature dropped 3 degrees to 64 C. Squeezed the bag a
fair bit. Since I'm an idiot, I sparged with some hot water (at 70 C)
and completely forgot to calculate how much water I lost to the
grains. Guesstimating that I sparged with 2 litres, and I ended up
with ~11l in the kettle, so I shouldn't have lost more than 2l to the
grain.

Measured the SG to 1.042 at 48 C, so that should be 1.050 at 20 C
(according to [1]). This in turn puts the efficiency at 77% (according
to [2]). Not too shabby.

=== Boil ===

As per schedule. Managed to get an acceptable roll by putting the
kettle across two burners.

Fail 1: Did not check volume before flame out. Turns out I was 2
liters short. Stupid. Was in a rush and pretty tired at this point so
I decided to top up with tap water. It'll probably be fine.

OG: 1.054

That's a bit too high I think. Brooklyn Brewery's beer has ABV 5%, and
this will probably end up closer to 6%. I blame the 77% efficiency...

NTS: And now I know why pre-boil gravity matters. Dilute next time
     around.
