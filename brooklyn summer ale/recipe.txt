There are a bunch of Summer Ale clone recipes floating around on the
intertubes. I'm basing this one mostly on these:

This will be a BIAB mash at 65C. I perceive the original to be quite
light bodied, hence the low mash temperature. I hope the pilsner malt
will also work to that effect.


20 litre batch

Ingredients:
   3 kg Maris Otter pale malt
 1.5 kg pilsner malt
  50 g Cascade hops
  20 g Amarillo hops
   1   Nottingham British Ale Yeast

Hop schedule:
  0 minutes: 20 g Cascade hops
 60 minutes: 15 g Cascade hops
 75 minutes: Protafloc or Irish Moss
 90 minutes: 15 g Cascade hops

Dry hop with 20 g Amarillo.
